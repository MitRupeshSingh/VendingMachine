vending machine to accomplish.

We have 2 enum type: named as Coin and Item which save all the denomination of coin according to the Name 
and also save items name according to their price.

We have vendingMachineExample which perform adding of coins in the machine and selecting the items from the vending machine.

There are two more options called "RETURN" and "CANCEL" too.
